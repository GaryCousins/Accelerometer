# GY-61 Accelerometer
Two sketches one to allow calibration of a channel and the other to allow monitoring of the device.  The calibrations code should be run for each channel holding the device horizontally in each of the three planes, the ADC channel will need to be edited for each separate run.

The monitoring code provided instantaneous results for the channel and the vector sum (which should come to 1g ±5%).  If it doesn’t recalculate the calibrations figures (it will differ device to device) and update the code.

Free to use, but I’d be keen to know if it’s being used for anything interesting.
